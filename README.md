MPE Emulator
============

A [VSTÂ® plugin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology) for
enhancing non-MPE MIDI streams with MPE
([MIDI Polyphonic Expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI#MIDI_Polyphonic_Expression))
capabilities based on user-defined mappings and rules, for Linux and Windows.

MPE Emulator is a MIDI proxy: an intermediary plugin which turns
non-polyphonic, single channel aftertouch (channel pressure), pitch bend, or
any MIDI Control Change (CC) message into polyphonic by applying them
selectively to the lowest, highest, oldest, or newest note, either across the
whole keyboard or restricted to a range of keys based on a configurable
keyboard split point. It can also remap and reshape controller data, and do
various other tricks to increase the expressiveness of a musical performance.

Features
--------

 * Retroactively add MPE functionality to non-MPE-capable MIDI input devices.
 * Remap controllers, e.g. turn modulation wheel data into MPE aftertouch and
   vice-versa.
 * Invert MIDI expression and controller data, and apply various other
   distortions.

MPE Emulator Lite
-----------------

MPE Emulator Lite is a platform-independent JS plugin for
[REAPER](https://http://reaper.fm/) v6.74 and above which provides the most
fundamental [features](#features) of MPE Emulator.

<a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a>

<a id="install"></a>

Installation
------------

<a id="install-dist"></a>

### Before Installing: Choosing a Distribution

If your plugin host application supports VST 2.4, then you should download and
install the FST version of MPE Emulator.

If your plugin host only supports VST 3, or if you can live with a few quirks
and edge case bugs due to the incomplete MIDI support in the VST 3 protocol,
then you should try the VST 3 bundle on both Windows and Linux.

If you are using an older VST 3 host, or if you are running a 32 bit (also
known as "i686" or "x86") VST 3 host on a 64 bit Linux system, then it might
not be able to load the VST 3 bundle, so you will have to go with a VST 3
single file MPE Emulator package that matches the architecture of your host
application.

The 32 bit versions are usually only needed by those who deliberately use a 32
bit plugin host application, e.g. because they want to keep using some really
old plugins which are not available for 64 bit systems.

If you are in doubt, then try the 64 bit FST version, and if your plugin host
application doesn't recognize it, then try the VST 3 bundle, and if that still
fails to load, then try the 64 bit VST 3 single file version, then the 32 bit
FST version, then the 32 bit VST 3 single file version, and so on.

required minimum version of REAPER is v6.74.

<a id="windows-deps"></a>

#### Dependencies on Windows

Typical Windows systems usually have the MSVC library already installed, but in
case you need it, you can download it from
[Microsoft's website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).

(Most people need the `X64` version of this library. To use the 32 bit version
of the plugin, you will need the `X86` version of the library. See the
[Before Installing: Choosing a Distribution](#install-dist) section below for
more information.)

<a id="linux-deps"></a>

#### Dependencies on Linux

On Linux, the `libxcb`, `libxcb-render`, and `libcairo` libraries, and either
the `kdialog` or the `zenity` application are required to run MPE Emulator. To
install them on Debian based distributions (e.g. Ubuntu), you can use the
following command:

    sudo apt-get install libxcb1 libxcb-render0 libcairo2 zenity kdialog

Note: if you want to run the 32 bit version of MPE Emulator on a 64 bit system,
then you will have to install the 32 bit version of the libraries, for example:

    sudo apt-get install libxcb1:i386 libxcb-render0:i386 libcairo2:i386 zenity kdialog

<a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a>

<a id="usage"></a>

Usage
-----

Place MPE Emulator in the signal chain between the raw MIDI input and a
synthesizer plugin in the plugin host application. The exact steps to set up
MIDI routing vary between different plugin host applications, so consult the
documentation of your one.

    +---------------+ single channel +--------------+           +-------------+
    |               | raw MIDI data  |              | MPE data  |             |
    | MIDI keyboard |--------------->| MPE Emulator |---------->| Synthesizer |
    |               |                |              |           |             |
    +---------------+                +--------------+           +-------------+

<a id="usage-knobs"></a>

### Knobs

Most of the parameters that control the settings of the MIDI signal
transformations can be adjusted via virtual knobs on the screen:

 * Move the mouse cursor over a knob, and use the mouse wheel or move the mouse
   while holding down the left mouse button for adjusting the value.

 * Double click on a knob to reset it to its default value.

<a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a>

<a id="usage-zone"></a>

### Zone Configuration

An MPE zone is a group of MIDI channels where one channel is used for sending
global MIDI events and controller changes which apply to all active notes
(manager channel), and the other channels are allocated for individual
polyphonic notes and controller events (member channels). Each controller event
that is sent on a member channel is applied only to the note (or notes) that is
played on that MIDI channel. One of the possible zones is called the "lower"
zone and the other is called "upper". This has nothing to do with note pitches,
these names actually refer to the layout of MIDI channel numbers.

Currently, MPE Emulator uses only one zone which can be either the lower or the
upper zone. The exact details of these are not important, what's important is
that MPE Emulator and the MPE-capable synthesizer must agree on the manager and
the member channel layout. This can be achieved either by manually setting up
the same MPE configuration in both the synthesizer and in MPE Emulator, or
alternatively, MPE Emulator can send an MPE Configuration Message (MCM), and if
the synthesizer implements MPE properly, then it will automatically configure
itself to match the settings in MPE Emulator. (Though in practice, even some
widely used commercial synthesizers ignore MCM messages, so you will likely
have to manually verify that the zone settings of MPE Emulator and the
synthesizer match up.)

#### Import Settings, Export Settings

The two icons at the top left corner of the "Main" configuration section allow
saving and loading settings as ordinary files, e.g. for transferring them
across projects, different host applications, computers, etc.

#### Override Release Velocity With Triggered Velocity (RelVel=TrigVel, Z1ORV)

Most MIDI keyboards emit Note Off events with note velocity set to either 0%,
50%, or 100%, regardless of how slow or fast the corresponding key is released.
However, some synthesizers can utilize note release velocity, for example, to
set the amplitude envelope release time accordingly. MPE Emulator remembers the
note velocity for each triggered note, and can override the release velocity
that is sent by the MIDI device to match the trigger velocity, so that softer
notes are also release softly, and high velocity notes are also released with a
high velocity.

#### Emit MCM on Reset (MCM)

This toggle switch tells MPE Emulator to emit MPE Configuration Messages (MCM),
or don't bother, because the synthesizer would just ignore them anyways.

#### Zone Type (ZONE, Z1TYP)

Click on the switch to change the channel layout used by MPE Emulator:

 * **Lower**: channel 1 is the manager channel, channel 2-16 can be used as
   member channels.

 * **Upper**: channel 16 is the manager channel, channel 1-15 can be used as
   member channels.

#### Channels (CHAN, Z1CHN)

The number of channels to use as member channels. This determines the number of
available polyphonic voices to use (within the limits of the synthesizer).

#### Excess Note Handling (STEAL, Z1ENH)

Tells MPE Emulator what to do then a new note is triggered while all polyphonic
voices are in use:

 * **Never**: there's no voice-stealing, the new note is ignored.

 * **Low**: the lowest note is stopped, and the new note is played on the
   channel where it used to be.

 * **High**: the highest note is stopped, and the new note is played on the
   channel where it used to be.

 * **Old**: the oldest note is stopped, and the new note is played on the
   channel where it used to be.

 * **New**: the newest note is stopped (the one played before the new one), and
   the new note is played on the channel where it used to be.

<a id="usage-zone-anchor"></a>

#### Anchor (ANCH, Z1ANC)

A split point for the keyboard. Each side of the keyboard can be
[transposed](#usage-zone-transpose-below) independently from each other, and
expression and controller events can be applied differently to them. For
example, one may want to send channel pressure (aftertouch) events only to the
newest or the highest note above A3, but not to bass notes or chords played
with the left hand.

<a id="usage-zone-transpose-below"></a>

#### Transpose Below Anchor (TR BA, Z1TRB)

Select how many semitones notes below the [anchor](#usage-zone-anchor) should
be transposed up or down. This can be useful e.g. for extending the range of
small keyboards with only a few octaves, or for playing the same note with
different expression settings.

#### Transpose Above Anchor (TR AA, Z1TRA)

Select how many semitones notes above the [anchor](#usage-zone-anchor) should
be transposed up or down. This can be useful e.g. for extending the range of
small keyboards with only a few octaves, or for playing the same note with
different expression settings.

<a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a>

<a id="usage-rule"></a>

### Rules

<a id="usage-rule-in"></a>

#### Input (IN, Z1RxIN)

Click on the box next to the "IN" label to select an input controller (MIDI CC)
for the rule. CC events that are not matched by any rule's input settings are
sent globally on the manager channel, and those that are matched by one or more
rules are handled as the rules specify. The possible values are:

 * **none**: turn off the rule entirely.

 * **MIDI Learn**: the first controller message that is received after
   selecting this option will be assigned to the input of the rule.

 * **Pitch Wheel**: the pitch wheel.

 * **Channel Pressure (Aftertouch)**: channel pressure, also known as channel
   aftertouch.

 * **CC0** - *CC119*: normal MIDI CC numbers that are usually assigned to
   various knobs and faders on a MIDI keyboard. (Note: the mod wheel is *CC1*.)

**Note**: if you accidentally open the controller selector, just click on the
already selected item to close it.

<a id="usage-rule-out"></a>

#### Output (OUT, Z1RxOU)

Click on the box next to the "OUT" label to select the output controller (MIDI
CC) for the rule. Usually it should be the same as the [input](#usage-rule-in),
but in some cases, you might want to remap a particular controller to another.
For example, if your MIDI keyboard does not have channel pressure (aftertouch)
functionality, but aftertouch is assigned to some functionality in a particular
synthesizer, then you can remap e.g. mod wheel events to be sent as channel
pressure: assign the mod wheel to the input, and select channel aftertouch for
the output, and then whenever you turn the mod wheel, the synthesizer will
receive an aftertouch message instead of it. (Unfortunately, aftertouch is
known to have some
[bugs and quirks in some plugin type and host combinations](#bugs-known).)

The available options are the same as for the [input](#usage-rule-in), but the
**MIDI Learn** option is ignored for this parameter.

**Note**: if you accidentally open the controller selector, just click on the
already selected item to close it.

<a id="usage-rule-init"></a>

#### Initial Value (INIT, Z1RxIV)

The initial value of the rule (before distortions). See
[Reset](#usage-rule-reset) for the details.

<a id="usage-rule-target"></a>

#### Target (TARGET, Z1RxTR)

Which polyphonic note (channel) to send the output of the rule:

 * **Global**: send on the manager channel, and let the synthesizer apply it to
   all active notes.

 * **All BA**: send to all notes below the [anchor](#usage-zone-anchor).

 * **All AA**: send to all notes above the [anchor](#usage-zone-anchor).

 * **Low**: send on the channel that belongs to the lowest key that is being
   pressed across the entire keyboard.

 * **High**: send on the channel that belongs to the highest key that is being
   pressed across the entire keyboard.

 * **Old**: send to the channel which belongs to the key that has been pressed
   for the longest time across the entire keyboard.

 * **New**: send to the channel which belongs to the key that has been pressed
   for the shortest time across the entire keyboard.

 * **Low BA**: send on the channel that belongs to the lowest key that is being
   pressed below the [anchor](#usage-zone-anchor).

 * **High BA**: send on the channel that belongs to the highest key that is
   being pressed below the [anchor](#usage-zone-anchor).

 * **Old BA**: send to the channel which belongs to the key that has been
   pressed for the longest time below the [anchor](#usage-zone-anchor).

 * **New BA**: send to the channel which belongs to the key that has been
   pressed for the shortest time below the [anchor](#usage-zone-anchor).

 * **Low AA**: send on the channel that belongs to the lowest key that is being
   pressed above the [anchor](#usage-zone-anchor).

 * **High AA**: send on the channel that belongs to the highest key that is
   being pressed above the [anchor](#usage-zone-anchor).

 * **Old AA**: send to the channel which belongs to the key that has been
   pressed for the longest time above the [anchor](#usage-zone-anchor).

 * **New AA**: send to the channel which belongs to the key that has been
   pressed for the shortest time above the [anchor](#usage-zone-anchor).

**Note**: "above the anchor" here includes the anchor key itself.

<a href="usage-rule-dist"></a>

#### Distortion Level (DIST, Z1RxDL)

How much to distort the flat, linear curve of the controller with the selected
[distortion function](#usage-rule-dist-type).

<a id="usage-rule-invert"></a>

#### Invert (Z1RxNV)

Flip the controller: when 0% is received on the input, send 100%, and when the
input is at 100%, then send 0%.

<a id="usage-rule-reset"></a>

#### Reset (Z1RxRS)

Select note initialization and reset behaviour. A reset can occur in one of two
ways:

 * When the [target](#usage-rule-target) of a rule is "Global", then the
   output controller of the rule will be reset when the plugin is
   re-initialized by the host, and when the [zone configuration](#usage-zone)
   is changed.

 * When the target is anything else, then a reset can occur when a new note is
   triggered or an old one is stopped. A reset may affect the new note itself,
   and also the notes that used to be the targets of a rule before the note
   event, or which become the targets of a rule after the note event.

   (For example, when the target of a rule is the highest note and a C4 is
   being played, then a reset occurs when the C5 key is pressed, affecting both
   the C4's channel and the C5's channel, because the former used to be the
   only note and therefore also the highest note, and now the latter is the
   highest. Then if the C5 note is released, then C4 becomes the highest again,
   and it also triggers a reset.)

The options for performing resets are:

 * **INI**: send the [initial value](#usage-rule-init) of the rule to the
   affected notes.

 * **LST**: send the value that was received most recently for this rule to the
   affected notes.

 * **OFF**: no reset is sent to any channels, everything stays as it is until
   a new control event happens.

#### Midpoint (Z1RxMP)

Move the mouse cursor over the first function graph icon at the top right
corner of a rule, and start moving it while holding the left mouse button
down, or start using the mouse wheel to adjust the midpoint of the rule's
[input](#usage-rule-in). For example, if the midpoint is at 75%, then when the
rule's input controller is at 50%, MPE Emulator will send 75%. Moving the
controller between 0% and 50% will make MPE Emulator emit values between 0% and
75%, and moving the controller between 50% and 100% will make MPE Emulator emit
values between 75% and 100%.

Together with the [Invert](#usage-rule-invert) toggle, this makes it possible
to create a pair of rules which turn the two halves of the pitch bend wheel
into different controllers, and to misuse it in various creative ways.

<a id="usage-rule-dist-type"></a>

#### Distortion Type (Z1RxDT)

Click on the second function graph icon at the top right corner of a rule, or
use the mouse wheel while holding the mouse cursor over it to select the
non-linearity curve that the rule will use when its
[distortion level](#usage-rule-dist) parameter is set to a value above 0%.

### Known Issues and Quirks

<a id="bugs-known-reaper-7-18"></a>

#### REAPER 7.18 (and below) lets raw MIDI control data pass through the VST 3 version

When a VST 3 plugin outputs MIDI controller messages in
[REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/) 7.18 and below versions, they get merged with
the raw MIDI input regardless of whether the "_Replaces MIDI bus_" or the
"_Merges with MIDI bus_" setting is selected. This makes the VST 3 version of
MPE Emulator unusable in the affected REAPER versions.
[The bug](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=292338) was fixed in 7.19.

The FST (VST 2.4) version of MPE Emulator works fine in all versions of REAPER.

<a id="bugs-known-ardour"></a>

#### Ardour 8.6 (and below) ignores Channel Pressure (Aftertouch) events emitted by plugins

There's a bug in both the VST 2 and the VST 3 implementation in
[Ardour](https://ardour.org/) 8.6 and below versions which makes it drop
Channel Pressure (Aftertouch) events (and Program Change events in case of VST
2).  [The bug](https://github.com/Ardour/ardour/pull/899) was fixed in 8.7.

 * Control messages emitted by the VST 3 version of MPE Emulator are lost when
   the synthesizer is a VST 2 plugin.

 * FL Studio seems to misinterpret Pitch Bend messages emitted by the VST 3
   version of MPE Emulator, resulting in random (and sometimes invalid) values
   being sent to synthesizer plugins.

 * [Setting up plugins that output MIDI requires a few steps](#faq-flstudio).

#### VST 3 Note On and CC event ordering issues

A VST 3 plugin has no way to know the exact order of MIDI note events and
controller events on its input, and has no way to communicate it on its output,
because MIDI support is fundamentally broken in the VST 3 protocol.

MPE Emulator does what can be done to work around this, but since the
protocol's design makes it impossible to ensure the sequentiality between note
events and controller events which need to occur at the same moment, there might
be cases where the VST 3 version of MPE Emulator cannot fully satisfy the
requirements of a synthesizer which expects CC and note events that belong
together to come in a particular well defined order.

The reason for this is that the VST 3 protocol separates the continuous and
consistent MIDI stream that comes out of MIDI input devices into separate
streams of note-related events and controller events, and passes the latter to
plugins masqueraded as parameter automation. On the output side, a VST 3 plugin
needs to emit its outgoing MIDI CC messages wrapped into a special event type
(`LegacyMIDICCOutEvent`), also separated from note events, and these then get
converted to the expected input format of the next plugin in the chain by the
host application.

Note that the FST (VST 2.4) version does not suffer from these problems (as
long as the host implements MIDI properly), since the VST 2 standard has full
support for MIDI and its extensions like MPE.

#### The mod wheel or a CC event is not handled with polyphony despite matching one of the rules

Though the MPE specification allows basically any controller event to be sent
on the polyphonic channels (member channels) and to be handled individually for
each note, many commercial synthesizers use only the pitch wheel, the channel
pressure, and CC 74 (a.k.a. Brightness, Timbre, Sound 5, etc.) with polyphony,
because these are the ones that are mandated by the standard. If you set up a
rule in MPE Emulator to make e.g. the mod wheel polyphonic and the synthesizer
ignores it or still applies it globally, then MPE Emulator has no influence on
it, and the synthesizer is doing nothing wrong with respect to the standard.

Most DAW applications have a plugin or a special tool which lets you peek into
the raw MIDI messages that are sent and received by each plugin, bus, and MIDI
track. If you see something there that is clearly wrong on MPE Emulator's side, 
and it's not a [known quirk with a particular host and plugin type combination](#bugs-known)
then please [report it as a bug](https://github.com/attilammagyar/mpe-emulator/issues).

Issues with polyphonic expression can also be the result of the DAW
application merging the raw MIDI data together with MPE Emulator's output. In
some cases, this is a bug in the DAW application
(e.g. [REAPER 7.18 and below](#bugs-known-reaper-7-18)), in other cases, the
DAW application should have an option somewhere to turn this off.

If all else fails, a workaround might be to sacrifice a channel in order to
separate the MPE stream from the raw MIDI stream:

 * Set both your synthesizer and MPE Emulator to use the
   [lower zone with 14 channels](#usage-zone).

 * Set your MIDI keyboard to use channel 16.

Alternatively, you can use channel 1 on your keyboard, and configure the upper
zone with 14 channels in your synthesizer and in MPE Emulator. What's important
is to have the keyboard use a MIDI channel which is outside the MPE zone that
is used by the synthesizer and MPE Emulator.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

<a id="faq-mac"></a>

### Mac version?

Sorry, it's not likely to happen anytime soon, unless someone is willing to
create and maintain a Mac fork of MPE Emulator. For me to do it, it would
require quite a large investment, both in terms of effort and financially. If
MacOS would be available (at a reasonable price) for installing it in a virtual
machine that could be used for testing, I'd consider that. But as long as it
cannot be obtained (legally) without also buying a Mac, and I'm happy with my
current computer, I'm not going to invest in a new one.

If you use [REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/) (or any DAW which supports REAPER's
[JSFX](https://www.reaper.fm/sdk/js/js.php) plugin format), then you should try
[MPE Emulator Lite](#lite) which implements most of MPE Emulator's features,
and it runs on any platform that is supported by REAPER, including various Mac
configurations.

### FL Studio: How to set up MPE Emulator?

Create an instance of MPE Emulator and create an instance of the synthesizer
that you want to use with MPE. Then you will have to connect these two, and you
will also have to set up the CC inputs of MPE Emulator. You may need to adjust
the pitch bend range as well.

#### Connect MPE Emulator to a synthesizer

1. Open the "_Detailed settings_" options for MPE Emulator by using the small
   cogwheel icon near the top left corner of its FL Studio plugin window.

2. Open the "_VST wrapper settings_" dialog for MPE Emulator by clicking the
   icon which features a connector plug and a cogwheel.

3. In the "_MIDI_" section, pick an "_Output port_" number.

4. Open the "_Detailed settings_" options for the synthesizer plugin by using
   the small cogwheel icon near the top left corner of its FL Studio plugin
   window.

5. Open the "_VST wrapper settings_" dialog for the synthesizer by clicking the
   icon which features a connector plug and a cogwheel.

6. In the "_MIDI_" section, set the same number for the "_Input port_" that you
   have configured for MPE Emulator's "_Output port_" in step 3.

#### Set up the pitch bend range

1. Open the "_Detailed settings_" options for MPE Emulator by using the small
   cogwheel icon near the top left corner of its FL Studio plugin window.

2. Near the top right corner of the plugin window, you will find an input box
   titled "_Pitch knob range (semitones)_". Its default value is 2.

3. Set its value to 12.

4. Repeat the same steps for the synthesizer.

#### Link MIDI CC events to MPE Emulator's MIDI CC helper parameters

1. Click on the small triangle in the top left corner of the plugin window of
   MPE Emulator, and select the "_Browse parameters_" menu item.

2. Find the CC parameter in the browser that you want to assign to one of the
   knobs, faders, or other gadgets of your MIDI input device. Click on it with
   the right mouse button.

3. Select the "_Link to controller..._" menu item.

4. Turn the knob or move the fader on your MIDI input device until FL Studio
   recognizes it.

**Note**:

 * Make sure that MPE Emulator is selected in the "_Channel rack_" window
   when you want to play a synthesizer with MPE, otherwise the data from your
   MIDI input device will go directly to the selected synthesizer, without MPE
   Emulator getting a chance to enhance it.

 * As of its v2024.1.1 build 4239 version,
   [FL Studio seems to have some quirks](#bugs-known-fl-studio) when it comes
   to MIDI plugins (e.g. Pitch Bend messages emitted by the VST 3 version of
   MPE Emulator get messed up by FL Studio).

### Why do you say FST instead of VST 2?

> VST is a registered trademark of Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH.

I'm not a lawyer, so I have no idea if it would be trademark infringement for
me to claim VST 2.4 compatibility for MPE Emulator without obtaining a license
from Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH, so I don't do it; especially since they
no longer issue new licenses for VST 2 to anybody. Instead, I use the name of
an open source programming library which makes it possible to build plugins
that can be loaded into VST 2.4 hosts without requiring, violating, or
otherwise having anything to do with that license:
[FST](https://git.iem.at/zmoelnig/FST).
